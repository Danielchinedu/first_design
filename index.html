         <h1>Here is a timeline of Jane Goodall's life.</h1>
          <li>1934 - Valerie Jane Morris-Goodall, known as</br> Jane Goodall, was born on April 3, 1934 in</br> London, England.</li>
          <li>1941 - Inspired by The Story of Dr. Doolittle, she</br> dreamt of going to Africa to study animals one</br> day.</li>
          <li>1952 - She got a job as a typist at Oxford</br> University. She later worked for a film studio.</li>
          <li>1956 - An opportunity that changed her life. She</br> was invited by a friend to visit their family farm</br> in Kenya, Africa.</li>
          <li>1957 - At age 23, Jane set foot in Africa. In Kenya</br>  she met a famous anthropologist, Dr. Louis</br>  Leakey, who eventually hired her to be his</br>  secretary at the Coryndon Museum (now the </br> National Museum of Kenya) in Nairobi.</br>  Recognising her talent, he decided she was the </br> right person to take on a study of chimps in the</br>  Gombe Stream Reserve in Tanzania. When Jane</br>  returned to England, Dr. Leakey began raising</br>  funds for the project.</li>
           <li>1960 - Jane, accompanied by her mother, set up</br>  camp at the Gombe Stream Reserve in </br> Tanzania. Jane spent hours every day observing</br>  the chimpanzees, noting down their dietary </br> habits and food-gathering ingenuity. In</br>  November, her mother returned to England.</li>
           <li>1962 - With Dr. Leakey's help, Jane was</br>  accepted into a programme at Cambridge</br>  University. After her first term, Jane headed</br>  back to Africa. This time, she met Baron Hugo</br>  van Lawick, a photographer/filmmaker from the</br>  National Geographic magazine. She was his</br>  assignment - he took pictures of her while she </br> worked.</li>
           <li>1964 - On March 28, 1964 Jane and Hugo</br>  wedded. They returned to Gombe to continue </br> researching chimps.</li>
           <li>1966 - She graduated from Cambridge and</br>  became professionally known as Dr. Jane</br>  Goodall.</li>
           <li>1967 - In March of 1967, Jane gave birth to her </br> son, Hugo. They nicknamed him "Grub."</li>
           <li>1974 - Jane and Hugo divorced. This same year,</br>  Jane observed that chimps waged war on other</br>  groups of chimps, and even carried out</br>  cannibalism.</li> 
           <li>1975 - Jane met Derek Bryceson, the head of</br>  the Tanzanian National Park, and married him.</br>  Unfortunately, soon after the wedding, Derek</br>  died of cancer.</li>
           <li>1977 to present - Jane founded the Jane</br>  Goodall Institute to help people understand the</br>  importance of preserving the forests and the</br>  animals who lived in them. Over the years</br>  several programs have developed to help others</br>  realise that they, too, can make a difference in</br>  the world around them.</li>
